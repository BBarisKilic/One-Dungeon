    "aboutDetailText": "One Dungeon developed during the Midyear 2022 Flame Game Jam. It is a 1-Bit style game, consists of one level, runs only on one platform, and, lastly, it is a one dungeon game.\n\nAre you interested in developing a game more than playing a game? Then do not hesitate to check out the GitHub repository of the game. One Dungeon is open source and available publicly.\n\nThe game is powered by Flame Engine and Flutter. Flame is a minimalist Flutter game engine that provides a nice set of somewhat independent modules you can choose.\n\nIn the source code, you will see tested and %100 covered clean code. The project has been created using Very Good CLI. Also used Flame Behaviors package that applies separation of concerns to game logic in the form of Entities and Behaviors. Other packages worth mentioning are Bloc, Equatable, Freezed, GetIt and Mocktail.\n\nLastly,  One Dungeon supports localizations, and English and German languages are already available.",
